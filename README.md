The beginning of my future.

I seriously feel like this is the start of everything beautiful that I have ever dreamed of.
Not only because of all the things that I can receive, but because this is my destiny coming into fruition.

I remember being a young child and proclaiming that I wanted to be a computer whiz. Times have gotten extremely tough,
but through the power of God and the grace of Christ, here I am today; fulfilling my childhood dreams.

There have been many sacrafices that I have made; many of them, I am not proud of. But I am here in this moment.
All of the events that have led up to this moment were worth it. I have no regrets. I am moving forward with everything that
the Lord God has equipped me with. With a loving family and team of individuals around me, there is nothing that I cannot acheive.
I strive to take the best of the best with me and to stay in touch with my loved ones. I want to give them the help that they
deserve so that I may be of assistance to help them see and reach their full potential and destiny.

There is going to be a lot of hard work. There are going to be more tears; more heartache; more trials. That is why we are down
here on this Earth. But I guarantee that those things will not be in vain. Every tear, every death, and every second will be worth
it in the end. When everyone who I come in contact with or have come in contact with stands before our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
it is my mission, responsibility, and duty to touch as many lives as I can by proclaiming Jesus Christ as Lord.
